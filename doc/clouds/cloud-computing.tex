Although HTCondor has long supported accessing cloud resources as though they
were part of the Grid, the differences between clouds and the Grid have
made it difficult to convert access into utility; a job in the Grid universe
starts a virtual machine, rather than the user's executable.

Since version 8.7.0, HTCondor has included a tool, \Condor{annex}, to help
users and administrators use cloud resources to run HTCondor jobs.

Although this is generally true for the development series, \Condor{annex}
is under active development; its features, limitations, and documentation
are all subject to change with little or no notice.  Furthermore, this
documentation should not be considered normative (or exhaustive); it describes
\Condor{annex} as it currently exists and is currently implemented, rather
than as it ought to behave.
