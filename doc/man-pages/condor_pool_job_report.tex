\Description

\Condor{pool\_job\_info} is a Linux-only script
tool that is designed to be run nightly out from cron.
It usually runs on the central manager, or other machine
that has ADMIN permissions to fetch the startd history logs
from all of the startd in the pool.  After fetching these
logs, it then generates a report about job runtime, and
mails it to the administrators, as defined by the
\Macro{CONDOR\_ADMIN} parameter in the config file.
